                Hi, I'm Mubaraq Somuyiwa, but my friends call me Fortress. As a
                product designer, UX researcher, and UX writer with years of
                hands-on experience, I've had the privilege of working on
                diverse projects with cross-cultural, remote teams. I've played
                both leadership and team member roles, bringing my expertise to
                the table in user research, interaction design, responsive
                design, and rapid prototyping.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-3">
                But, I don't just have technical skills. I have a knack for
                solving complex problems for top companies, and I possess
                critical thinking, foresight, leadership, and organizational
                abilities that enable me to manage teams and projects
                effectively. While I prioritize meeting clients' business goals,
                I also strive to create a positive impact on users by focusing
                on behavior-first designs and psychology-driven designs,
                aligning experiences with users' behaviors and cognitive
                processes.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-3">
                When I'm not designing, I am passionate about giving back to the
                community through mentorship, volunteering and being relevant.
                In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies,
                and keeping fit through exercise and swimming.
